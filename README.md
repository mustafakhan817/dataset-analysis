The dataset (`UberDataset.csv`) contains columns like:

- `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`: Time of the trip
- `CATEGORY`: Business or Personal

- Cleans and formats the data (dates, missing values, duplicates)
- Explores patterns like:
  - Miles distribution
  - Ride frequency by category and purpose
  - Time trends (monthly volume)
- Shows relationships between columns (e.g., boxplots, correlation)
- Plots the most common start/stop locations on a map
